= R5RS-Spec

R5RS-Spec is an executable language specification for R5RS Scheme written using AnySpec.

Because it has no dependency on the target runtime this specification is very useful for bootstrapping the early stages of a new implementation, as well as giving you an idea of how much of the specification your target runtime implements.

This specification has been tested against PLT-R5RS, and was used in the development of {FLea}[http://github.com/aarongough/flea]
